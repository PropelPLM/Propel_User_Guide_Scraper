Compliance Overview
Many products need to comply with a variety of different regulations, such as Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), UL Standards, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and various ISO standards. You can manage the compliance status for your items in Propel using Specifications and Declarations. 
In the Specification, you define the level at which you report compliance. In the Declaration, through a change control process, you declare the compliance status.
Specifications
In the Specification, you determine the Items and Manufacturer Parts that must comply with a Specification, as well as any exemptions that may apply. Depending on your processes, your specification can apply to the Top-level Assemblies / Finished Goods, or at the component level and the system can roll-up the compliance status.
