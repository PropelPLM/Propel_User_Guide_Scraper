Override Field Labels for Propel Packaged Fields
Propel delivers a number of packaged objects with fields. The field labels are not editable for packaged fields. You can relabel a packaged field label with the Translation Workbench Override.
For example, in our Manufacturer Part object, we use a Distributor field that is a lookup to a Manufacturer (or Account). Sometimes customers want to change the label to Partner or Contract Manufacturer. 
Go to Setup > User Interface > Translation Workbench > Override
Package = Propel PLM
Language = English (or whatever language you want to override)
Setup Component, can be any, but for field labels, select Custom Field
Object, select the desired object, in this example, Manufacturer Part
Aspect = Field Label
Locate the field label that you want to update and double-click into the Field Label Override cell for that label.

Click Save.
