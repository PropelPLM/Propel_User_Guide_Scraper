Manage BOM Costs
Propel lets you determine which Items in the Bill of Materials (BOM) will be used to calculate assembly costs and component costs.
Note: You will need to Configure Cost Roll-ups for this to work.
Set the Items that will Calculate Costs
Select the Items tab from the navigation bar and click on the name of the Item for which you want to manage costs.
Select the applicable Item Revision draft and select the BOM tab.
In the View dropdown list, select With Manufacturers.
Click Edit Draft. 
There are two options for including Items in the cost rollup for the parent Item: select all Items, or select individual Items. To include all of the items in the BOM, select the Include All in Cost Roll-up checkbox. To include only specific Items, such as the Preferred Items, in the cost roll-up, select the checkboxes for the individual Items in the Include in Cost Roll-up column.
The Cost Roll-Up will be displayed in the record header.
Click Save and then click Done Editing.
