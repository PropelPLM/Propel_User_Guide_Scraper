Assign Propel to a User
Before users can access and start working with Propel, you need to grant them access to the application.
This article assumes the users you want to assign to Propel already exist in Salesforce. If not, go to the Create a New Propel User article.
Assign Propel to existing users
Go to Setup > Apps > Packaging > Installed Packages to show a list of all installed packages.
Click Propel PLM.
Click Manage Licenses. 
Note: This button will be greyed out if you have no available licenses. Contact Propel Support for assistance.
Select the individual users to which you want to assign Propel and click Add. Alternately, if you want to add all the users, click Add All Users then click OK.
Test the New User
You can test the new user by logging in as the user and opening the Propel App.
Go to Setup > Users > Users.
Click Login beside the new user.
Click the App Launcher icon and select the Propel App you assigned to that user. If you don’t see the app in the initial list, select View All.
Verify that the Propel app loaded.
Once you’ve Assigned Propel to your users, you can direct them to our Login and Launch Propel article.
