Edit Costs on Released BOMs
You can edit manufacturer part costs on the Bill of Materials (BOM) tab of a released Revision as long as you have the proper permissions. Setting up the permissions will need to be done by your Propel Administrator.
Note: You will also need to Configure Cost Roll-ups for this to work.
Edit Costs on a BOM
Select the Items tab from the navigation bar and click on the name of the item you want to edit costs on.
From the Item Revision dropdown, select the released revision you want to edit.
In the top right, click Edit Cost.
Select the BOM tab and select the With Manufacturers view. Locate the Item that you want to change the cost on.
In one of the Cost columns, double-click on the value you want to edit. The value will be highlighted and the cursor will blink when you have entered editing mode.
Edit the value and then click outside of the highlighted box. The Cancel and Save buttons will become enabled once you make a change. Click Save. Note that until you save the change, there will be a warning symbol on the BOM Tab letting you know there are unsaved changes on the tab.
When you have finished editing costs, click Done Editing.
