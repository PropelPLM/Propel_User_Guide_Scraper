Propel Lightning Web Components (LWC)
Introduced in our Fall ‘20 release for Change and Quality records, and then followed by Item records in Beta in our Spring ’21 release, Lightning Web Components (LWCs) give you an incredible amount of flexibility in how you configure the records that end users will see and work with. Because of this flexibility and configurability, as well as the increased performance they offer end users, LWCs are gradually replacing our old React code that Propel was previously built on.
The articles below will help you get familiar with Propel LWCs and give you detailed instructions on how to configure the various components to take advantage of Propel’s features and functionality.
