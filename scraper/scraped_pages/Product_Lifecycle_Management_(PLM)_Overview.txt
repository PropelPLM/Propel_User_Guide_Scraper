Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Overview
Propel lets you manage your product lifecycle as you go from product inception all the way through to the hands of your customers. You can create and manage hierarchical relationships between all of the items (parts and documents) that you produce as well as those you procure from outside manufacturers. It also provides flexible version control for all of your items and lets you easily standardize your processes across your organization.
Each of the sections below lets you drill down for more information on the different aspects of Propel’s PLM, where you’ll also find links to setup articles and how to articles on working with Propel.
Items
Items are the individual parts, assemblies, documents, and anything else associated with your products that you track in Propel during the PLM lifecycle. Item records let you track and manage item revisions, bills of material (BOMs), manufacturer parts and related change orders and quality records.
