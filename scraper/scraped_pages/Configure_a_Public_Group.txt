Configure a Public Group
Groups are sets of users that share a particular role. Having users in a group allows you to set sharing rules for the group and can be used for Approval groups, Email notification groups, and other functions.
This article covers creating and configuring a new public group. If you have an existing group that you want to assign or remove users from, go to our Assign a User to a Public Group article. 
Go to Setup > Administration > Users > Public Groups.
Click New. 
Add a Label to name the new group; the Group Name field will auto-populate.
NOTE: Do not use semi-colons (";") in public group names to avoid parsing issues. 
In the Search field, select Users to see a list of users that can be added to that group. You can also add other complete Groups into the Public Group.
Select the users you want to add from the Available Members section of the multi picklist. Click Add move them to the Selected Members section.
5. Click Save once complete.
