Quoted Costs and Other Roll-Up Types
Propel rolls up the costs in the BOM using the manufacturer part costs of the items on the BOM.
Regardless of if costs are locked or not (see more about Locked Costs), you have the option on a per BOM basis to set a sub-assembly to Quoted. When Quoted, the component costs of the subassembly's BOM are not included in the roll-up regardless of the Include in Cost Roll-up or Use Cost checkboxes being checked.
In this example, you are looking at the BOM for TLA 9.
Let's say that the supplier split for Item 1 is 100% for Mfr Part A, so that Item 1 is $4.
For Assy X, you have 3 options.
Option 1: Quoted
This may happen when your manufacturing partner has quoted you the cost for that assembly (possibly including the labor), so you use the cost on Mfr Part C to show represent that total.
You can check Quoted for Assy X, and Include in Cost Roll-up (or Use Cost) for Mfr Part C.
In this case, Propel will ignore the $4 for Mfr Part A in Item 1, and rollup the total for TLA 9 will be $12 (from Mfr Part C).
Option 2: Rolled-up
This is more common where you want to use the cost roll-up from the underlying components in a BOM.
You can leave Quoted unchecked for Assy X, and uncheck Include in Cost Roll-up (or Use Cost) for Mfr Part C.
In this case, Propel will use the rolled-up costs for Item 1 which is $4, because we say 100% of Item 1 is from Mfr Part A.
Option 3: Rolled-up and Quoted
This may happen if you want to include the cost of Mfr Part C in the roll-up for TLA 9. Maybe the cost on Mfr Part C represents tooling or labor, and you want for the total to include that plus the material costs of the components in the BOM.
You can leave Quoted unchecked for Assy X, and check Include in Cost Roll-up (or Use Cost) for Mfr Part C.
In this case, Propel will use the rolled-up cost for Item 1 plus the cost of Mfr Part C. $4+$12 = $16.
