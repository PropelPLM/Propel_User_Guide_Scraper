Quality Management System (QMS) Overview
Companies in regulated industries require an extra level of rigor in managing processes and training. Quality records let you manage processes such as complaints and Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs), ensuring necessary data is documented and applicable reviews and approvals are completed. Propel’s Training Records module  allows you to set and maintain training plans, set up training quizzes, and manage training records.
Each of the sections below lets you drill down for more information on the different aspects of Propel’s QMS, where you’ll also find links to setup articles and how to articles on working with Propel.
Quality
Propel’s Quality Management ensures that companies can track and report on quality processes such as Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs), Supplier Corrective Action Requests (SCARs), Defects and Complaints. Like Changes, Quality records let you add Affected Items to the process to ensure that all products related to the potential issue are identified and tracked.
