Deactivate a Propel User
Deactivating an existing Propel user and removing their Propel license will free up that license for other Propel users. It’s important to note that users in Salesforce can never be deleted, they can only be deactivated. This ensures that the recorded history of their actions remains in the system for historic and audit purposes. 
To fully deactivate a user, you need to remove their Propel license and deactivate them in Salesforce.
Note: If the user will still be using Salesforce, just not Propel, then you only need to remove that user’s Propel license.
